# linear-life-time
<p>
  This is a project that I found abandoned, in half, when I oppened my PyCharm, I think I stopped because it seemed a little depressing, but with noisy neighbors resulting no sleep, and as the server for my
  online course is being fixed, I decided to finish it.
  <br>
  
  In the end of it, it has passed some hours, the sleep has come again with some easy jazz music. Have a great nigth! ðŸ˜´

<h2>What it do?</h2>
<p>
  It uses the time you have been on Earth and your habits and provides an average life expectancy that you still have based on generic questions. Of course, using 0 scientific basis.

<p>
  Make sure you have <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html'>Tkinter</a> installed, <b>which you should</b> since it's a Python native GUI framework that's built into the Python standard library.
